# Threebody-unitless-_barycentre_simulation
## Info

### Files explanation

- [ ] `3body_plot.py` plots the three-body trajectories in XY and XZ planes.
- [ ] `ani_3body_plot.py` generates the animation of the three-body motions such that the two objects of the same mass orbit in a barycenter circle.
- [ ] `binary_threebody_unitless.f90` is the Fortran program for simulating the required simulation motion.
- [ ] `binary_threebody_unitless` is the complied F90 program. Running it will ask the user to put the position (x, y, and z) and velocities (vx, vy, and vz) for the test body; all values are unitless.
- [ ] `threebody_output.dat` is the data file of the simulation.
- [ ] All plots and animations are manually collected in folders with the name `x_y_z_n_vx_vy_vz`. For example, the `0_0_0_n_0_0_0` file contains the plot and the animations for the test body with (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) and (vx, vy, vz) = (0, 0, 0).

### Acknowledgments

- [ ] The three-body simulation algorithm uses the Verlet Algorithm, which is the algorithm I learned in my Computational Physics Course.
- [ ] The Fortran program is developed with ChatGPT's help. Specifically, ChatGPT helped me to write the position data into a `.dat` file.
- [ ] `3body_plot.py` and `ani_3body_plot.py` are massively generated by ChatGPT, with some tiny corrections on the labels, colors, etc. from me.
